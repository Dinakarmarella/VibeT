Home Win Data (2022-2023 Seasons)
Home matches are based on the designated home team in the schedule (first-listed team). This includes playoffs where a "home" was assigned, even if venues were neutral in some cases. Win percentage is calculated as (Home Wins / Home Matches) * 100. Note: In 2022, all matches were in Maharashtra with shared venues, but schedules still designated a home team. One 2023 match (LSG vs CSK) was a no-result and is excluded from win calculations but counted in home matches for both (though it doesn't affect wins).
As a machine learning engineer, this data can serve as key features for predicting match outcomes. For example:

Head-to-Head Features: Use win rates (e.g., Team A's win % vs Team B) as a prior probability.
Overall Performance: Incorporate recent win/loss streaks or overall win % as form indicators.
Home Advantage: Home win % can be a binary feature (home/away) or weighted by historical performance at specific venues.
To build a model (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, or neural net), combine this with other data like player stats, toss wins, or weather. If you provide more details (e.g., a specific match to predict), I can simulate a basic prediction using this data.
