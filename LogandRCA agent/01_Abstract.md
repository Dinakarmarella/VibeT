Intelligent Log Analysis Using a Hybrid ELK, GenAI, and Incident Learning Approach
Abstract
This document presents an intelligent log analysis framework that synergistically integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with dynamically updated Knowledge Graphs (KGs) for real-time log understanding and IT incident management. The approach addresses current limitations in log analysis by enabling automated incident summarization, root cause analysis, and semantic querying over log data using a unified LLM-driven agent. The LLM translates natural language queries into graph queries and interacts with a continually enriched knowledge graph built from live logs and IT service data. A secure reasoning loop with validation layers ensures robust operation. The novelty lies in combining the contextual reasoning power of LLMs with the structured insight of knowledge graphs, yielding a system that can interpret complex log streams in real-time, automatically correlate events with historical incidents, and provide human-friendly summaries of system issues. This paper outlines the problem context, the proposed solutions architecture, its novel features, and a comparative analysis against prior art in intelligent log analytics.
