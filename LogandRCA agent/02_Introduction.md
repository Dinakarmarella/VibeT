Introduction
Modern IT systems generate massive volumes of log data that record events, errors, and performance metrics. These logs are a valuable source of information for diagnosing incidents and understanding system behaviour. However, current log analysis practices struggle to keep pace with this data deluge. Engineers often rely on static dashboards and manual queries to sift through unstructured log messages, a process that is time-consuming and prone to missing subtle correlations. Traditional tools lack semantic understanding  they treat logs as text strings rather than as carriers of meaning  and hence cannot summarize incidents or explain root causes in human terms. Furthermore, existing monitoring solutions are usually siloed from historical incident knowledge; context from past outages or fixes is not automatically brought to bear on new issues. This disconnect means troubleshooting often starts from scratch, even if similar problems have occurred before.
Recent advances in AI offer an opportunity to revolutionize log analysis. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated an ability to understand and generate human-like text, including the domain-specific jargon found in system logs. Meanwhile, knowledge graphs excel at capturing relationships between entities (servers, services, errors, configuration changes, etc.) in a structured form. By integrating an LLM with a live-updating knowledge graph, we propose a system that understands log data in context. The LLM can interpret logs, translate free-form questions into structured queries, and reason about the system state, while the knowledge graph provides a memory of entities, events, and their relations drawn both from streaming logs and IT Service Management (ITSM) records. In essence, the introduction of an LLMdriven agent supervising a knowledge graph enables a real-time, explainable, and context-aware analysis of logs. The following sections detail the problem space, the novel approach we introduce, and how it advances the state of the art in intelligent log analytics.
