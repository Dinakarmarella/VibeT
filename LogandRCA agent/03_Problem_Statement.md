Problem Statement
Despite numerous tools for log management, current practices exhibit several shortcomings that impede efficient incident response:
 Over-Reliance on Dashboards and Keywords: Engineers often monitor systems via predefined dashboards or search for error keywords manually. This approach fails when issues manifest as complex patterns across disparate logs rather than obvious error strings. Static dashboards cannot adapt to novel failure modes, and important clues may be overlooked if one does not use the exact right search terms.
 Lack of Semantic Understanding: Traditional log analysis treats log entries as raw text or simple key-value pairs. There is little understanding of the meaning behind a log message. For example, a message Node X lost heartbeat with Node Y might indicate a network partition  a human can infer this, but a typical tool does not. The absence of natural language comprehension means logs arent summarized or contextualized; the onus is on the operator to interpret cryptic messages and connect the dots.
 Disconnection from Historical Context: When an incident occurs, engineers must manually recall or lookup past incidents that resemble the current one. Present tools do not automatically link ongoing events to historical incident reports or root causes. Valuable lessons learned in the past (e.g. a certain error preceded a database crash last month) remain locked in archives. This lack of memory leads to repetitive investigative effort and sometimes reinvention of fixes.
 Siloed Data Sources: Logs often exist separately from other relevant data like configuration changes, user reports, or monitoring alerts. With data spread across systems, engineers struggle to piece together a coherent timeline. Current log analytics platforms rarely integrate well with ITSM ticket data or network topology information, missing higher-level correlations (for instance, linking a spike in error logs to a recently deployed software update).
 Manual and Reactive Workflow: Because tools lack automation in understanding logs, incident response is largely reactive. Alerts might fire on simple thresholds, but writing these rules requires foresight and maintenance. There is no automated reasoner that looks at all incoming data and proactively identifies likely root causes or synthesizes a summary for human consumption. The burden of analysis remains on humans operating under stress, which is error-prone and slow.
In summary, the problem is that log analysis today is low-level and disconnected  it surfaces raw data without insight, demands expertise to interpret, and fails to leverage past knowledge. This limits an organizations ability to respond quickly to incidents and learn from them. The following section introduces our approach that addresses these issues by blending LLMs and knowledge graphs for a more intelligent solution.
