Novelty of the Proposed Approach
Our proposed system introduces a novel end-to-end pipeline that combines LLM capabilities with knowledge graph reasoning to overcome the above limitations. The key innovative aspects are:
 Natural Language to Graph Query Translation: The system employs an LLM as an interpreter between human language and machine queries. Users can ask questions about the logs in natural language (e.g. Why did the payment service crash yesterday around 3 PM?), and the LLM component translates this into precise graph queries or search instructions. The LLM understands intent and context, then formulates queries (such as Cypher or SQL for the knowledge graph or time-bounded searches in log indices) that retrieve relevant data. This translation allows semantic querying over log data  users are no longer limited by rigid query languages or exact keyword matches.
 Dynamic Knowledge Graph Enrichment via Plugins: At the core of the system is a continually updated knowledge graph that represents the IT environment and its state. Whats novel is the way this graph is enriched in real-time from multiple sources through specialized plugins. One plugin processes streaming logs to extract structured information (for example, recognizing entities like server names, application components, error codes, and relationships like causes or temporal sequences from log messages). Another plugin interfaces with ITSM systems to integrate incident tickets, change records, and alerts into the graph. The knowledge graph thus grows to encapsulate both the live operational data and historical incident knowledge. Unlike static CMDBs (Configuration Management Databases), this graph is automatically built and updated, providing a rich context for analysis.
 Unified LLM Agent for Reasoning Loop: The LLM is not a passive translator; it acts as an agent that orchestrates the reasoning process end-to-end. When a query or an alert comes in, the LLM agent can perform a loop of actions: it may query the knowledge graph for relevant nodes (e.g. recent errors on Service A), analyze the results, possibly ask a follow-up question or refine the query, and even update the knowledge graph with new findings. This resembles an autonomous troubleshooting assistant. The novelty here is in using a single LLM-driven agent to tie together all steps  from interpretation of the problem, retrieval of data, correlation of events, to generating a final explanation. It leverages chain-of-thought reasoning, guiding itself through sub-tasks (much like how a human expert would drill down into logs, check metrics, recall similar past incidents, etc.). By embedding this logic in an LLM, we gain flexibility: the agent can adapt its strategy to different scenarios without explicit reprogramming.
 Security and Validation Layers: Integrating an LLM into operational infrastructure raises concerns  for example, ensuring that the LLMs generated queries are safe and that it cannot be prompted to perform unauthorized actions. Our system is novel in building a safety harness around the LLM agent. All inputs (queries, log contents) are sanitized to remove any potentially malicious content (such as injection attacks in log text). The LLMs actions are constrained via a policy engine  certain high-risk operations (like deleting data) are simply not allowed, and all graph queries run through a validator that checks for efficiency and safety (no full graph scans that could slow the system, for instance). Additionally, the responses of the LLM agent can be audited: the system keeps a trace of what data was retrieved and how the conclusion was formed, providing an explanation for its answers. These layers ensure that the powerful reasoning of the LLM is harnessed in a controlled and robust manner suitable for enterprise environments.
Collectively, these novel features produce an intelligent log analysis system that is context-aware, conversational, and proactive. It understands logs not just as text but as events in a connected story, enriched by wider knowledge. It can answer complex questions and justify answers by referencing structured data. And it continuously learns: every incident handled makes the knowledge graph richer, enabling faster root cause identification for future issues. The next section will detail representative prior art to highlight how our approach differs from and advances beyond existing solutions.
