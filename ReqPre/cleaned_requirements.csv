 Please read our Rules of Conduct httpsopensourcemicrosoftcomcodeofconduct 
 Please search existing issues to avoid creating duplicates 

 Describe the feature youd like 
Hi I would like the ability to track how much code was generated by an Human VS how much code was generated by AI Copilot Cline etc

My current idea is to create a new extension and listen to vscodeworkspaceonDidChangeTextDocument and just track the changes there But the event today does not report if another extension is generating that code or if its a human If we could just have a property flagging if the event was trigged by another extension that probably would be enough 

So my ask here is would be possible to add some way for developers of extensions to identify if the code being added in the editor is being made by an AI extension or by an human

The next challenge will be how to expose and consume it but we can do it more easily just saving to a temp file and readingcleaning it after commits"

69,"edit context accessibility lag This first issue is a serious one When I type delete or replace text in a document for example in a Python script the change is not immediately reported by the screen reader The change does occur visually on the screen but its as if NVDA is frozen until I move the cursor away from and then back to the modified area

This also happens when pasting text For example
I am at the beginning of a line that I want to replace I select the entire line with ShiftEnd and the selection is read correctly I then paste with CtrlV and absolutely nothing happensthere is no speech feedback and no update on my Braille display However if I move the cursor vertically off the line and then back onto it I can confirm that the text has been replaced correctly This behavior is incredibly disruptive and is ruining my user experience with VSCode which is my favorite piece of software and is always running on all my computers

77,"Search String Only in Files Changed Uncommitted via Git Problem
Currently in VS Code there is no builtin way to search for a string only within files that are modified but not yet committed ie tracked by Git but with changes in the working tree or index

Workaround
A common workaround involves using the terminal

git diff nameonly

Then copying that list into the files to include field in VS Codes search panel However this is manual errorprone and repetitive

Proposed Feature
Add a builtin filterscope option in the Global Search panel

 Search only in files with uncommitted Git changes

This filter would automatically

Detect files listed by git diff nameonly

Limit the search scope to these files

Benefits

 Speeds up debugging and code review workflows
 Helps in focused refactoring
 Makes Git integration in VS Code even more powerful"

 Describe the feature youd like 

When I clone and open a repository in VS Code for the first time and the repo has a devcontainer config VS Code suggests to open the repo in the dev container I almost always choose this option as I really like dev containers
Once VS Code has built the dev container the right bottom part of the window opens a terminal which is also great
Only thing is that this terminal view is split and to the left of it there is the ports view for the forwarded ports I usually dont need this an it steals a lot of space from the terminal I want to be able to specify what views are open by default on a new devcontainer and how much space they can occupy and where

Ideally this should be in the user settings and be applied to all dev containers"
102,"Allow extra outputs from GenerationMixingenerate  Feature request

Hi all first of all if this feature already exists I apologise

With the rise of multimodal LLMs if would be great if we could add extra outputs to GenerationMixingenerate results For instance if we implement a model like Janus from DeepSeek there are two output heads One lmhead and one imagehead The outputs of forward method have extra attributes that cant be passed to the generate results

I know these multimodal models are not common within this repo so this is pretty bleeding edge but Im working on research in this domain and it would be great if we could forward all model outputs to the generate result Maybe through an attribute like kwargoutputs in classes like GenerateDecoderOnlyOutput

 Motivation

As far as I understand its possible to feed the extra output during the autoregressive loop through prepareinputsforgeneration and updatemodelkwargsforgeneration where we can forward model outputs to the next forward call

But when it comes to forward these outputs to the result of generate it doesnt seem possible I know the generation mixin is geared towards text generation but it would be great to be able to forward extra model outputs

Happy to have a try but not sure how big of a PR it would be especially if it touches the pytorch  tf  flax implementations"

113,"transformers serve Fails to Handle Messages with Nested Content  System Info

 Bug Description

When using the transformers serve command to serve a model it fails to process chat messages containing nested content raising a TypeError Specifically when integrating the served model endpoint with a chat interface such as Gradio and the messages sent have a nested structure eg lists instead of strings or dictionaries as expected the server encounters an unhandled exception This results in the inability to properly process the incoming request

The issue stems from an assumption in the code that the content field of each message is either a string or a dictionary However if content is a list as might occur with certain chat interfaces or userprovided inputs the server attempts to access it using a string key messagecontenttext which leads to the following error

TypeError list indices must be integers or slices not str

 Expected Behaviour

To add this feature we could modify the existing assisteddecoding in generationutilspy or introduce a new decoding strategy eg multicandidatesassisteddecoding
Would the maintainers be open to such an addition Im happy to contribute to the implementation and documentation

164,"ImageClassificationPipeline preprocess should accept numpytensor arrays  Feature request

Currently ImageClassificationPipeline expects a PIL image or a string pointing to a URL
This makes using existing datasets eg from torchvision a bit more difficult in the generic case A nontransformers model would work with torch tensors but not necessarily with a PIL image whereas ImageClassificationPipeline wont work with torch tensors

Under the hood it seems to me that the imageprocessor should determine what inputs it supports  Im not sure why the loadimage is hardcoded andor does not support other wellknown types

 Motivation

I have a factory method to generate pipelines or use torchvision models and the two are not currently interchangeable without having to monkeypatch that preprocess function or provide a wrapper class for ImageClassificationPipeline that does not use the loadimage function

I could make the changes to the code if needed Adding support is trivial"

195,"Allow loadbestmodelatendTrue to work when savesteps  evalsteps and best model is saved  Feature request

Allow loadbestmodelatendTrue to work even when savesteps is not a round multiple of evalsteps and optionally preserve the best model even when reaching savetotallimit 

This change would remove the current restriction that enforces savesteps to be a multiple of evalsteps when loadbestmodelatendTrue Additionally it proposes an optional flag to prevent deletion of the best model when the total number of saved checkpoints exceeds the limit 

No specific paper is associated with this feature This is a usability improvement based on common user workflows and constraints 

 Motivation

Users with limited disk space eg Colab users often want to
 Save more frequently eg savesteps100 to avoid losing progress
 Evaluate less frequently eg evalsteps200 to save compute
 Still be able to load the best model at the end using loadbestmodelatendTrue

Currently this is not possible unless savesteps is a multiple of evalsteps which is unnecessarily restrictive The restriction could be lifted by simply ensuring that the best model is saved at least once during training regardless of the saveeval frequency ratio

Additionally users may want to keep the best model even when reaching the savetotallimit which currently may cause the best model to be deleted

This request is related to the discussion in Hugging Face Transformers GitHub issues where users have reported frustration over this limitation


 Your contribution

Although I currently lack the resources to submit a PR myself Im happy to support the discussion and help refine the proposal I believe contributions go beyond code  asking questions sharing feedback and helping others in the community are also valuable ways to contribute 
I encourage others who are interested in this feature to join the discussion or take up the implementation Im also happy to test or provide input if someone decides to work on it 
In the meantime Ill continue to support the project by spreading the word and showing appreciation for the librarys impact"

  destroyed

215,"Support NCCL register userbuffer for P2P communication in NCCL backend   The feature motivation and pitch

In NCCL backend implementation ProcessGroupNCCLcpp it looks NCCL register buffer for P2P communication is NOT supported as following code shows


  if ncclComm  nullptr 
     HACK currently we are using this function for NVLS
     reductions and thats why using OpTypeALLREDUCE
     If we end up using this API for zerocopy P2P we might
     need to refactor and account for different OpType
    ncclComm  initNCCLCommkey device OpTypeALLREDUCE
  


Im not sure if we have plan to support it in near future

Based on my understanding for P2P communication in a PP group in case of MegatronLM pretraining it cannot get the correct NCCL communicator with only the device key as multiple NCCL communicators are created for each sendrecv pair of ranks


auto ncclComm  getNCCLCommkey


And so you cannot call registerSegmentderegisterSegment with the right NCCL communicator

297,"Feature Request Allow torchinductorModelPackageLoader to load from an inmemory buffer   The feature motivation and pitch

Currently the constructor for this class requires a const stdstring modelpath which makes it impossible to integrate in deployment environments that have dedicated facilities for fetching file data from disk It would be great if this could be changed to also accept a spanconst stdbyte as input instead of a file path

 Alternatives

The workaround is to load the file into a ramfs and hardcode the path which is clunky

298,"Unpin dependency version when possible   The feature motivation and pitch

At the moment PyTorch wheels pin all their cuda dependencies to specific version which creates a lot of confusions during the update

Why not change them to xyzx100 which guarantees SYMVER compatibility
But in order to preserve test sanity reproducibility add testeddepsor similar sounding additional dependency one can use to install torch against the exact version it were builttested against

Ie pip install torchtesteddeps will preserve the existing behavior but pip install torch will be compatible with more recent versions of CUDA libraries within the same major version

 Alternatives

Keep doing what we are doing right now

299,"distributeddestroyprocessgroup uses extra GPU memory on GPU 0   Describe the bug

In the latest torch if only statement 2 is used without statement 1 then when distributeddestroyprocessgroup is called all processes will occupy a certain amount of GPU memory on GPU 0 before the process group is terminated

1
python
torchcudasetdevicelocalrank


2
python
deviceidtorchdevicecuda localrank


You can try to comment out statement 1 in the program and run the following program again You will find that when destroyprocessgroup is executed you can see through nvidiasmi that other ranks will not terminate the corresponding processes until they occupy a certain amount of GPU memory on GPU 0

However if you only use statement 1 but not statement 2 this problem will not occur

I raised issue 151457 and considered it to be an order issue with destroyprocessgroup but it seems that the order is irrelevant

In versions below 270 I never use statement 2 because it will cause 149119 but using only statement 1 will also cause the same problem

In the latest 271 this problem only occurs in the situation described at the beginning which may be related to the fixed issue 149119

318,"Bug Improve error message when function is passed as JSX child  Summary
When developers accidentally pass a function as a JSX child a common mistake for React beginners the current error message is technically correct but not helpful for debugging and doesnt suggest the most common solution

 React version
19x current stable

 Steps To Reproduce
1 Create a React component that renders a function directly as a child
jsx
function App 
  const handleClick    consolelogclicked
  return divhandleClickdiv  Missing parentheses  should be handleClick


2 Run the component
3 Observe the error message in the console

Current Behavior
The error message shows
Warning Functions are not valid as a React child This may happen if you return a Component instead of Component  from render
Expected Behavior
The error message should provide more specific guidance for the most common scenarios
Warning Functions are not valid as a React child This may happen if
 You forgot to call the function use functionName instead of functionName
 You meant to render a component use ComponentName  instead of ComponentName
 You intended to pass the function as a prop to a child component
Link to code example
A simple reproduction case can be created by rendering any function directly as JSX content without calling it
Additional Context
This error is frequently encountered by React beginners and the current message doesnt point toward the most common solution missing parentheses when calling a function This enhancement would improve the developer experience for new React developers by providing actionable suggestions
Error message improvements align with Reacts commitment to developer experience similar to other recent error message enhancements in the codebase"

321,"Bug Exception thrown by Error Boundary after production build in React 19 not visible in UI but reported via monitoring After deploying my application using React 19 to production I intermittently receive error notifications triggered by my custom error boundary ie componentDidCatch in a classbased ErrorBoundary component

The strange behavior is
		These exceptions do not appear in the UI  the app works as expected visually
		The error seems to occur only after the app has been used for a few days postdeployment
		I am able to catch the exception via monitoring tools eg Sentry LogRocket etc but cannot reproduce it or observe any direct malfunction in the UI
		This was not happening with React 18 and only began after migrating to React 19



Reproduction steps

Unfortunately the issue is hard to reproduce consistently but heres the general flow
	1	Deploy app to production using React 19
	2	Use the app normally for a first time
	3	Receive exception reports from componentDidCatch without seeing any UI impact
	4	The component tree that fails is not removed or visibly broken



Expected behavior
		If an exception is thrown and caught by an error boundary I expect it to show a fallback UI or at least interrupt rendering
		Silent failures with no visible issues but background error boundary triggers are unexpected



Actual behavior
		Exception is thrown in production and caught by componentDidCatch
		No fallback UI is rendered
		No visual issues seen by users
		Only monitoring tools detect the issue



Additional context
		Using ErrorBoundary class component
		Exception is only caught in production builds built with vite build  webpack
		Could this be related to React 19s new compiler or effects handling"

After generating the network I see that a while loop in place of GRU I tried to run the network with open source TFLM but I am not able to When I had logs in TFLM it seems the GRU is actually decomposed into multiple operators but still not able to run the network
When the GRU addition is replaced as below by having additional argument unrollTrue then I dont see any while loop in the tflite model The GRU  is decomposed to basic operations  But because stateful is set to True I could see Quantization and dequantization operations and some additional floating point operations When statefulFalse I could see all the operators with int8 quantization There are no float32 operators What exactly stateful and unroll arguments are doing here Does unroll is unrolling the time sequence of GRU or it also decomposing the GRU why when stateful is set to False I dont see any floating point operations I assume that stateful is to feed the state variables to the next batch How is it impacting the quantization and dequantization

 Current behavior

Currently the behavior of tfmathreducemin is that when there are multiple equal minimum elements the backward pass splits the upstream gradient equally among them This behavior is neither documented nor immediately obvious It would be helpful to have an option for controlling how gradients are handled in case of tieseither splitting them evenly or redirecting the entire gradient to the first minimum element similar to how tfargmin works At the very least the current behavior should be documented

Attached is a standalone example demonstrating how the gradients for a function using tfreducemin differ from those for a function using tfargmin to achieve the same computation

443,"GPU Not Detected by TensorFlow Despite Proper System Setup Description
In several cases TensorFlow fails to detect or utilize available NVIDIA GPUs even when the system is correctly configured with the appropriate hardware drivers CUDA and cuDNN versions This issue has been observed across different environments and setups

Impact
This significantly limits model training performance and efficiency especially for deep learning tasks that depend heavily on GPU acceleration It leads to increased training time and resource usage

Observed Behavior
tfconfiglistphysicaldevicesGPU returns an empty list

nvidiasmi detects the GPU and shows proper driver installation

No explicit TensorFlow errors are thrown making it hard to diagnose

Expected Behavior
TensorFlow should detect and utilize the available NVIDIA GPU for training when all required dependencies and drivers are correctly installed

System Example can be modified by the user
OS Ubuntu 2204 LTS

TensorFlow Version 2150

CUDA Version 121

cuDNN Version 8x

GPU NVIDIA RTX 3060 12 GB

Installed via pip

Suggested Improvements
Provide clearer diagnostic messages when GPU detection fails

Add automated GPU environment checks with recommendations

Consider offering a CLI or script to verify system compatibility before installation"

 Current behavior

On Ubuntu 2204 with TensorFlow 219 stable branch running the following code

python
import tensorflow as tf
x  tfrandomnormal4 10 mean175 stddev05
initializer  tfinitializerstruncatednormalmean00 stddev005
w  tfVariableinitializer10 5 dtypetffloat32
b  tfVariabletfzeros5 dtypetffloat32
y  tfnnsoftmaxtfmatmulx w  b
yconv  tfnnconv2dx w strides1 1 1 1 paddingVALID

results in a crash with abortcore dumped showing
Check failed index  0  index  numtotaldims Invalid index from the dimension 30C
Aborted core dumped

However in TensorFlow 2200dev20250604 nightly the same code raises a catchable InvalidArgumentError
convolution input must be 4dimensional 410 OpConv2D name

 Current behavior

In 2170 several sorting and indexing ops yield outputs that diverge from NumPys behavior on a tensor containing NaN 
When run in nightly version CPU and GPU implementations often produce different results
