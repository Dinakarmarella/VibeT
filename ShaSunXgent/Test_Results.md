# Automated Content Agent - Test Results

This document summarizes the tests performed on the agent, the outcomes, and the resolutions for any issues found.

---

## Phase 1: Dry Run (Simulation)

- **Objective:** To verify the agent's setup, dependency installation, and ability to handle configuration errors gracefully.
- **Execution:** The agent was run using the virtual environment's Python interpreter with placeholder API keys in the `config.yaml` file.

### Initial Issues & Resolutions

1.  **Dependency Conflict:**
    - **Issue:** An `ImportError` occurred because the globally installed `tokenizers` library was an incorrect version required by the `transformers` library.
    - **Resolution:** A dedicated virtual environment (`.venv`) was created for the project, and all dependencies were installed into this isolated environment, which permanently resolved the conflict.

2.  **Missing Config File:**
    - **Issue:** The agent correctly reported an error that `config.yaml` was not found.
    - **Resolution:** The `config.yaml.template` was copied to `config.yaml` to provide the necessary configuration structure.

3.  **Model Name Typo:**
    - **Issue:** The agent failed to load the summarization model because the identifier in the config file was incomplete (`distilbart-cnn-6-6`).
    - **Resolution:** The model name was corrected to the full identifier `sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-6-6`.

### Final Outcome

The dry run was **successful**. The agent started, loaded all modules, correctly identified that the API keys were placeholders, and terminated gracefully without errors.

## Phase 2: Partial Live Test (Fetch & Process)

- **Objective:** To verify the agent's ability to use a valid API key to fetch live data from the YouTube API and process it with the AI model.
- **Execution:** A valid YouTube API key was provided for the test run.

### Initial Issues & Resolutions

1.  **Environment Variable Scope:**
    - **Issue:** An initial test using `set YOUTUBE_API_KEY=...` failed because the environment variable was not visible to the agent's execution session.
    - **Resolution:** For the test, the key was temporarily placed in `config.yaml`. The user was advised to remove it immediately after the test.

### Final Outcome

The partial live test was **successful**. The agent performed the following actions:

1.  **Authenticated** successfully with the YouTube Data API.
2.  **Fetched** 2 new videos that were not yet in its database:
    - `Will Modi and Trump&#39;s Friendship Boost Nifty &amp; Bank Nifty? Week Ahead  08 to 12 Sep 2025 (2nd Week)`
    - `&quot;Trump Obsession Of India&quot; Weekly Market Wrap - Nifty &amp; Bank Nifty - 1st Week Sep 2025`
3.  **Updated State:** Marked both videos as `fetched` in the `agent_state.db` database.
4.  **Processed:** Successfully generated an AI summary for each video's description.
5.  **Skipped Publish:** Correctly identified that the X/Twitter keys were missing and skipped the publishing step as expected.

**Log Output Snippet:**
```
Orchestrator: Running YouTube summary workflow...
Fetcher: Getting new YouTube videos...

## Phase 3: Full End-to-End Test (Pending)

- **Objective:** To verify the final step of the workflow: publishing the generated summary to X (Twitter).
- **Status:** This test is pending. To proceed, the user needs to provide the four X/Twitter API keys (`X_API_KEY`, `X_API_SECRET`, `X_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `X_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`) as environment variables.
