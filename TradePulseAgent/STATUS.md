# TradePulseAgent Status

## Purpose

The `TradePulseAgent` is designed to automatically fetch the latest financial news from the web, process it into a simple format, and post it. The ultimate goal is to create a social media bot for trading-related news.

## Current State

The agent is implemented with the following components:
- A data fetcher to scrape news from `forexfactory.com`.
- A simple data processor to format news into posts.
- A placeholder publisher that prints posts to the console.
- A scheduler to run the agent every 3 hours.

## Blocker

The agent is currently non-functional. The execution log (`agent.log`) shows a critical error:

`ERROR - Error fetching news from Forex Factory: 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.forexfactory.com/news`

This `403 Forbidden` error indicates that the website is actively blocking the agent's automated requests.

## Potential Solutions

1.  **Use a Public News API:** Instead of scraping a website directly, we can switch to a dedicated news provider that offers a free or freemium API (e.g., Alpha Vantage, NewsAPI.io). This is the most reliable and robust solution.
2.  **Advanced Scraping Techniques:** We could attempt to bypass the blocking by using more sophisticated methods, such as rotating proxies or employing a headless browser (e.g., Selenium, Playwright) to simulate a real user more closely. This approach is more complex and may not be consistently reliable.

## Next Steps

I am awaiting your decision on how to proceed. I recommend **Solution 1 (Use a Public News API)** for its stability and reliability.
